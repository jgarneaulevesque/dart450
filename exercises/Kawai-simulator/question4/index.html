  <p class="question4">Sorry to going all the way through of this... You must be confused by now...<br> It is just the only way we can talk without being interrupted by the game's programming.<br> So... yeah... where to begin? I said earlier that I was kidnapped  which in fact <br> it's true... I don't belong in this world... well not in the visual novel game universe <br> I mean... I am from a retro shooting game called " Space Mania ". I am the protagonist <br> of this game well... I was... Until an obsessive man, who likes frantically my game,<br> he tried to rid me off of my game by copying the source code and put me in his mediocre <br> visual novel game without my consent. His goal was simple, it was to be able to satisfy <br> himself while seeing me nude... Yeah you hear me right... The whole point of <br> this game is to abuse me !!! This is really embarrassing...<p>
