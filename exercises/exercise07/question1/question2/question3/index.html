<p class="question3">My favourite book is "Alice in wonderland" by Lewis Carroll. I was really fond of the character feelings. It's like I really understand her worries about how she was confuse to be unable to detect if she was in a dream or in reality. Imagine that your whole world that you knew was just an illusion, a trick of our perception of reality. Wouldn't that be scary?</p>
